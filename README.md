  FINALLY got level loading to work. Added basic lighting. Procrastinating on commands.

  Scrapped the FPS aspect of the game. After so much development, I realized that just because it was cool, did not mean that it would play wells as a game. The remnants will still stay in the code, but... they will not be used. (https://youtu.be/KHE89-zGO7M) here is a youtube video in case you want to see how it looked before. Also, started work on implementing commands, and level loading. Left off on level loading causing segfaults. fscanf is sooooo cooool >:(

  Got the base raycaster to work (sorta). Used this awesome article (https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) to help. Still gotta do some tweaks

  Created the base for the engine. The current plan is to make a 2D game that is rendered in a classic DOOM style using raycasting
  Raycast logic should be done, though I have not been able to test due to not having figure out an algorithm to parse the position to screen position and render to ascii graphics.
  It is currently 1:24 AM of 10/11 so I am going to go to bed lol.
